  Sinapse is an opensource program for training neural networks to perform simple tasks, like function approximation, pattern recognition, classification and more.

  This project was created to help creating a system for medical diagnosis in the Federal University of São Carlos, Brazil, but serves as an all-purpose artificial neural network tool, helper, or even toy, to start experimenting with. 

  As an open-source project, everyone's invited to give opinions, suggestions, or just browse the code. 


  This program uses the fabulous AForge.NET library created by Andrew Kirillov, which is covered by a different license.
