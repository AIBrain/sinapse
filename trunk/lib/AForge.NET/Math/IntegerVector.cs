    ///   In linear algebra, a coordinate vector is an explicit representation of a vector
    ///   in an abstract vector space as an ordered list of numbers or, equivalently, as an
    ///   element of the coordinate space Fn. Coordinate vectors allow calculations with
    ///   abstract objects to be transformed into calculations with blocks of numbers (matrices
    ///   and column vectors), which we know how to do explicitly.
