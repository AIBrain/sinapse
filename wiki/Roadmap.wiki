= Sinapse Roadmap =
Sinapse aims to be a data-centric neural network software rather than network-centric like many simulators out there. User efforts should not be directed towards _modelling_ the network but on _feeding_, _training_ and _using_ those networks. An example is creating and testing _Computer Aided Decision Making_ systems, the main target of this project.

Further development will include features like Image, video and sound based input training, input data transformations and other techniques that directly improve performance of neural networks. At the end, the user should be able to export his created, trained and well-tested network directly to code, readly to be inserted into his own software without much effort.
