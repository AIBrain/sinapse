    ///   Factor analysis is a statistical method used to explain variability
    ///   among observed variables in terms of fewer unobserved variables called
    ///   factors. The observed variables are modeled as linear combinations of
    ///   the factors, plus "error" terms. The information gained about the
    ///   interdependencies can be used later to reduce the set of variables in
    ///   a dataset. Factor analysis originated in psychometrics, and is used in
    ///   behavioral sciences, social sciences, marketing, product management,
    ///   operations research, and other applied sciences that deal with large
    ///   quantities of data.
